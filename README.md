# MinimalEngine
A minimal game engine written in C++ using OpenGL. It is still in an early stage and only covers the bare minimum. Nontheless, it provides some basic classes, which hide a lot of OpenGL calls and provide methods to create simple games quickly.

## Example Projects
The Visual Studio solution contains some example projects which use the engine. Binaries compiled for Windows are available here on Github under releases.

* **Hello World**: A "Hello World" project which shows a rotating textured 3D cube.
* **TerrainGeneration**: Voxel terrain generation with Perlin noise and instanced rendering.
* **Portals**: Seemless real time portals using stencil testing.
* **LTiles**: Some random project that generates L-shaped tiles and renders them in 2D.

For a more detailed description of examples and the engine itself, you can visit my blog at jahnmichel.dev/blog.
